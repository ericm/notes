## General opinion on AI
- No general AI
- Narrow AI is a system built for an individual task.
- Measure success for a specific task - human intelligence is not measured this way.
- Self driving - fragile.
- Trained models of MNIST were training on colours, inverting them dropped accuracy to below 50%.
- Adding noise to image can confuse predictions.
- Supervised - humans do most of the work.
- Datasets are made by exploited ppl.
- A measue of intelligence
	- Complete a line pattern with no context, bouncing off a surface - basic geometry.
- Not good in environments that have unknowns.
	- Real world in most cases - fragile AI.
	- Humans have common sense
- For example - tested DNN on negatives of training data and it had terrible results.
- AI can focus on things like noise/colours in images to build a false sense of knowing what an object looks like.
- AI cannot extrapolate (General Intelligence).
