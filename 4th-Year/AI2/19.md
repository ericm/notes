Last Lecture :(
## General opinion on AI
- No general AI
- Narrow AI is a system built for an individual task.
- Not good in environments that have unknowns.
	- Real world in most cases - fragile AI.
- For example - tested DNN on negatives of training data and it had terrible results.
- AI can focus on things like noise/colours in images to build a false sense of knowing what an object looks like.
- AI cannot extrapolate (General Intelligence).
