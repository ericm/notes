## Agents 
- Perceives an **environment** via **sensors** and uses agent function to enact **actions**.
### Environments
- World is partially observable, stochastic.
- Chess, spam filter is fully observable, deterministic.
- **Single step** is when an agent makes a decision based on its current percept.
- **Sequential** is when you make decision based on more than that.
	- Chess is sequential.
	- Spam filter is single step.
- **Static vs dynamic** is whether the world changes when making decisions.
	- World is dynamic, grass growing  etc
	- Chess is static.
- **Discrete vs continuous**: Whether we can represent a world using integers vs real numbers.
	- Chess is discrete.
	- Spam is discrete
	- World is continuous.
### Types
- **Reactive agents** are stimulous responsive. Percept arrives and they base their decision based purely on that and dont think ahead. Stimulous then response.
- **Deliberative agents**: do think ahead. Works out the consequences and considers them by simulating them.
	- Eg: Chess.
## Table Driven Answer
Entry|Action	
---|---
000|MOVE
001|TURN(RIGHT, 2)
010|MOVE
011|MOVE
100|TURN(LEFT, 2)
101|TURN(LEFT, 2)
110|TURN(LEFT, 2)
111|TURN(LEFT, 2)
- **Table Driven** impossible if continuous.
