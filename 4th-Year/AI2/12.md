## Reinforcement Learning
- Reward or punish.
### Rewards
- Need to be concerned about future rewards.
- Optimise for cummulative reward. Discount rate goes up exponentially on each subsequent reward.
### Table learning
- Table has every possible percept and action pairing.
- Third column is a learned estimate of cummulative reward for choosing it.
- Q(s,a) = s = percept, a = action.
- *Table method is only possible if number of percepts and actions are finite.*
- Exploration will give you new experience while exploitation will always choose highest Q value.
- Update Q with the reward i just got + reward i will get if i choose the best action possible in the next state.
- Recusively this gives the expon
