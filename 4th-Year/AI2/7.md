## Recommender Systems
### User-Item Interactions
- Interaction matrix between users and items.
#### Problems
- If a 5 start scale, users may interact with scale differently.
- When something is good, it pulls in a broader community that are less impressed and average rating veers towards 3.5.
- Can also happen the opposite way.

### Exam Question

- Imagine you're building a recommender system for such and such.

### Non personalized

### Learning
- Linear regression on features such as age, sex, preferences can do well in a supervised set.

### Collaborative Filtering
- Uses other's optinions whom are similar to you to recommend.
### kNN 
- Distance between users will be done via cosine of rating vectors.
- Pearsons correlation - finds correlation between trends of features.
