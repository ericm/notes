## Sequence Models
Converting a singular feature to a sequence of items.
- Use RNN for image classifying
### RNN
- Get RNN to predict first word or else go back and adjust all the weights.
- Image captioning.

### Different length output Sequence-to-Sequence
- Pass output vector to decoder that returns sequence of correct length.

### Bidirectional RNN
Output depends on current inputs and previous inputs.
Can keep word alive to influence later probabilities.
The backwards direction is combined with forwards direction for weights after all the time has passed.
