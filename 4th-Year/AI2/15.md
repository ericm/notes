## State Space
- All the states you can get to from your start state.
## Search
- Insert successors into agenda of current state and find goal. If goal isnt found add all its successors.
- When removing from front of agenda, you stick it into the **search tree**. Make it a child of the previous state it came from.
- Use this to generate a path to the goal.

### Re-exploration
- Going down a different path but visiting the same sub-path multiple times.
### Solutions
- Discard any successor if it's the same as any previously generated successor.
