## State Space
- All the states you can get to from your start state.
## Search
- Insert successors into agenda of current state and find goal. If goal isnt found add all its successors.
- When removing from front of agenda, you stick it into the **search tree**. Make it a child of the previous state it came from.
- Use this to generate a path to the goal.

### Re-exploration
- Going down a different path but visiting the same sub-path multiple times.
### Solutions
- Discard any successor if it's the same as any previously generated successor.

### Agenda
- Implement as queue if breath-first and a stack if depth-first.

## Completeness
- Gurantees a solution
### Prevented by
- An infinite loop.
	- Breath first is complete because it won't visit children until all nodes on that level are explored.
	- Depth-first is not complete because it will.

## Optimality
- Shortest path.
- Looks for **branch factor** and **depth** of path to goal.
- Worst case for BFS is that the goal is on the back of the agenda (Queue).
### Branch Factor
- If you branch out every path, BFS will be b^d.
- Exponential, unusable
