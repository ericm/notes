## Matrix Factorization
- Model based collaborative filtering.
- Ratings matrix users x content.
### Embeddings
- Fine grained sparse vectors with a bunch of interests in a separate matrix. **user embedding**
- Embed matrix learned that shows how much each item represents the features in the interest matrix. **item embedding**.
	- These are known as **latent features** as they are learned by the system.
- Get the product of an entry in the user embedding with an entry in the item embedding to get the **predictive rating**. One is a column vector and one is a row vector so the result will be scalar.
		- The **actual rating** will then be compared and using gradient descent, the numbers will be tweaked.
