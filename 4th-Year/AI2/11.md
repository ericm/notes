## Genetic Algorithms
- Inherits from 2 previous version
- Variability from inherited characteristics.
- *Survival of the fittest* - well suited to their environment.
### Process
- Population of individual agents.
- Mutation - entropy/copy errors.
	- Bit switch is used for mutation - random portion of bits from both parents.
- Population in each iteration will always stay the same size.
### Fitness function
- Agent is usually evaluated multiple times and average score is taken.

### Roulette wheel
- Proportional segments of roulette wheel to amount of total score an agent has.
### Rank 
- ith rank over sum of scores chance of being picked.
### Tournament
- Take random N people, take fitest person and stick them into the population.
- N-1 others are put back into pool.
