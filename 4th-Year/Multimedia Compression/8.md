## More encoding
- Encoding number of consecutive numbers in a row can be encoded using a **difference value**, a size and coefficient.
- **Huffman table**: A category code can be put into the encoding to tell you the next number of bits.
- Runlength + Huffman code for each block appears at the start of each block's bitsteam.
- Special **eob** code that represents the rest of the coefficients are going to be 0.

## Containers
### Jpeg Spec
- Used in number of containers. Usually JPEG/Exif aka **.jpeg**.
- JFIF container spec contains colour specification.
### Loading spec
- It can specify how the bitstream is interpereted on loading.
