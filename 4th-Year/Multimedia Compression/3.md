### Median Cut
1. Create a 3d cube of colours using RGB as axes. One point per pixel.
2. Analyse how many times a particular value occurs for R, G and B.
3. Get the median value of colour with the largest range.
4. For the whole cube, divide the colours into 2 wherein one side has a median greater than the original and one side has a lesser median.
