## Colour Lookup Tables
Table of reduced points in image containing what colour should be where.
### Median Cut
1. Create a 3d cube of colours using RGB as axes. One point per pixel.
2. Analyse how many times a particular value occurs for R, G and B.
3. Get the median value of colour with the largest range.
4. For the whole cube, divide the colours into 2 based on the same colour wherein one side has a median greater than the original calculation and one side has a lesser median.
	- This operation should be applied on the cube as a whole.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 for one cube each round.
6. For each cube, get a representative value (RGB) and use this to represent all values in the cube.
	- Average, median, mode.
