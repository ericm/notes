## Quantization
- Applied to block of pixels.
- DCT allows less bits to be used to store values.
- Rounding colours to the nearest integer in the case of JPEG.
- Reconstruction of colours to their estimated original value entails a degree of *quanitzation error*.
- Quantization table is stored and used to divide the result of the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) of the image. The integer result is stored.
- Components such as chroma and luma are quantized separately and will have different quantization tables.
	- For example, chroma can be quantized more harshly at lower values.
