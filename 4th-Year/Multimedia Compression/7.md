## Quantization
- Applied to block of pixels.
- DCT allows less bits to be used to store values.
	- Huffman encoding based on range of coefficients is used to determins how many bits needed. Each value is categorised separately and encoded with huffman code (number of bits).
- Rounding colours to the nearest integer in the case of JPEG.
- Reconstruction of colours to their estimated original value entails a degree of *quanitzation error*.
- Quantization table is stored and used to divide the result of the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) of the image. The integer result is stored.
- Components such as chroma and luma are quantized separately and will have different quantization tables.
	- For example, chroma can be quantized more harshly at lower values.
### Encoding
- Zig zag encoded pattern is used when writing out quantized DCT coefficients into a bitstream.
- Makes all meaningful values at the start and rest to be 0.
