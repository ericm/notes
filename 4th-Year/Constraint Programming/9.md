#  Constraint Programming Lecture 9
15th February 2022

## Searching
### Symmetry
- Searches that for each correct solution it finds, it finds an equal one one.
- Inverse relationships. Add constraint that stops inverse relationship to equal solution.
- Symmetries can be found if you invert a matrix in magic square problem, etc. Adds unnecessary solutions.
- Generally in matrix models may rows/columns represent interchangable objects.
- Match patterns in solutions to find symmetries.
