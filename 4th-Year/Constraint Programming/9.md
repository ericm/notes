#  Constraint Programming Lecture 9
15th February 2022

## Searching
### Symmetry
- Searches that for each correct solution it finds, it finds an equal one one.
- Inverse relationships. Add constraint that stops inverse relationship to equal solution.
- Symmetries can be found if you invert a matrix in magic square problem, etc. Adds unnecessary solutions.
- Generally in matrix models may rows/columns represent interchangable objects.
- Match patterns in solutions to find symmetries.

### Golfer Problem
- Any 2 rows/columns are interchangable. 
- Symmetry made problem exponentially more complicated.

### Lexographic Ordering
- Find elements that always come after another element in every matrix, both row and column.
- In a matrix, ordering it lexographically will mean for element a, in every row and column you should be able to find a case where x comes after y for x<<y.
- If rows or columns are interchangable, reorder matrix so that it's lexographically ordered.
	- By imposin lex ordering, you reduce the number of symmetric solutions.
- Transpose matrix when adding lex contraint to focus on row instead of column.
