#  Constraint Programming Lecture 7
8th February 2022

## Scheduling Jobs on  multi capacity resources
- Constraint: Limited Memory, Power Demand capacity, etc.
- Known as **Finite Capacity Resource Scheduling**.
- Finite capacity in a point in time, scheduling resources to fit in before time runs out.
	- Each task has a consumption of resources as well as a time it wil take.

### Tasks
0 | d0 | c0 | s0 | e0
--| -- | -- | -- | --
1 | d1 | c1 | s1 | e1
2 | d2 | c2 | s2 | e2
3 | d3 | c3 | s3 | e3
n-1 | dn-1 | cn-1 | sn-1 | en-1

s = start time and e = end time are variables.
Tasks are rows
c = consumption

Maintain a **binary matrix** mapping a task to a point in time.

### Constraints
- Get a scalar product between the resource consumption column and the column at time i.
	- Constrain the sum of the product to be less than the resource capacity.
- Constrain a task start < time i and end > time.

## `cummulative`
- Constrains a list of tasks over time, with a capacity. Does our job for us.

## Changing Resource Capacity
- Create a dummy task to take up excess capacity at reduced times.
