## Problem
Put 1 to 8 in these circles without consecutive adjacent numbers.
![[Pasted image 20220118142318.png]]
- Centre has most connections, 1 and 8 only have 1 other respective consecutive number in the set, put them in the middle.
- 7 and 2 can only go at the sides due to the position of 8 and 1.
- Pair top and bottom, since 4 cannot go with 5, pair (4,6) and (3,5).

## Modelling
What are the variables, values, constraints?
**Variables**
**Domains**: Allowable values for each variable
**Constraints**: Restrictions on groups of variables. Defined in a relation between variables. Subset of cartesian product of its domains.
**Assignment**: Variables in the scope of a constraint that satify the constraint only.
