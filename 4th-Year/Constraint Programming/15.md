#  Constraint Programming Lecture 15
8th March 2022

### MAC- Maintaining  Arc Consistency

## Value Ordering
### Minimum Bandwidth
- Bandwidth = largest distance between a var and any constraint neighbour.

### Max Degree
- The vars with highest degree first

### Max Cardinality
- Max Degree
- Then biggest neighbours already in order
- Then break by max degree

- All NP-Hard

### Smallest Degree First
- Min remaining values at each point

### Dom/Deg
- When dense, min domain.
- When sparse, min degree.
### Dom/WDeg
- weighted degree

## Value Ordering
- NP-Hard
- Store a value *k* that marks the quality.
- Find the value in the domain that has the fewest conflicts with existing values, use this to lead the solution in the wipeout stage.
### Min Conflicts
- 
## Search Heuristics
- Backtrack before trying next value in a search, allowing you to wipeout an entire domain for a search tree node.
