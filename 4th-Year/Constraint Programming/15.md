#  Constraint Programming Lecture 15
8th March 2022

## Value Ordering
### Minimum Bandwidth
- Bandwidth = largest distance between a var and any constraint neighbour.

### Max Degree
- The vars with highest degree first

### Max Cardinality
- Max Degree
- Then biggest neighbours already in order
- 

- Store a value *k* that marks the quality.
- Find the valuue in the domain that has the fewest conflicts with existing values, use this to lead the solution in the wipeout stage.
## Search Heuristics
- Backtrack before trying next value in a search, allowing you to wipeout an entire domain for a search tree node.
