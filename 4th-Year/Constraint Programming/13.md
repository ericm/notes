#  Constraint Programming Lecture 13
1st March 2022

## All different
- Logic to figure out if a variable has to be a value based on all constraints.
- Map all possible values to all possible variables.
- When possible variables for value hits 1, assign it immediately.
- Logic is based on all constraints on all variables to narrow that down.
- Only works when you know every value can only be used once.
### Graph solution
- A matching is when a graph of constraints creates a unique one to one pairing of variables of size (num of pairs).
- M augmenting path - creates a biggern matching by switching edges in and out.
### Generalised Arc Consistent
- If you can find a tuple to satisfy the constraint with a tuple of values that may satisfy that constraint.
