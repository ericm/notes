#  Constraint Programming Lecture 12
24th February 2022

## Looking Forward downt the tree
- Define process that looks at problem as a whole, instead of backtracking.
### Process
- Change domains for variables looking forward for all potential possibilities.
- Same as backtracking except replace *check* with *forward_check*.
- When a domain is wiped out (*set to {}*), backtrack and recheck.
- Used to reduce the complexity going forward.
