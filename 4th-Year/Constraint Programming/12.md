#  Constraint Programming Lecture 12
24th February 2022

## Looking Forward downt the tree
- Define process that looks at problem as a whole, instead of backtracking.
- When solving problem, domain can be reduced for each set var by looking forward and back tracking when needed.
### Process
- Change domains for variables looking forward for all potential possibilities.
- Same as backtracking except replace *check* with *forward_check*.
- When a domain is wiped out (*set to {}*), backtrack and recheck.
- Used to reduce the complexity going forward.
### Thrashing
- Going down unnecessary paths.
- Resolve with AC3
	- CSP that tells you whether or not the any domain is arc consistent without being emptied.
- When a domain is a single value, bring it forward and do not search down that path any further. No point trying to reduce it to empty. Assign it to the variable.
- Always reduce the variable with the smallest domain as a larger domain will increase thrashing.
	- Maintain a stack of variables to be reduced in order to pull out smallest.
- Known as **Maintaining Arc Consistency**.
	- Forward check and arc consistency. 
	- Establish arc consistency on unassigned variables using AC3, etc when a domain is reduced.
	- Default in choco is to do this to solve problem.
	- *Doing this by hand is likely exam question.*
