## Type Synonyms

type String = [Char]
```

## Algebraic Data Type
```hs
data Bool' = False' | True'

is:true :: Bool' -> Bool
is_true False' = False
is_true _ = True

data Maybe a' = Nothing' | Just' a -- custom
	deriving (Show,Read,Eq,Ord) -- builtin classes it's derived.

divide ::  Int -> Int -> Maybe' Int
divide _ 0 = Nothing'
divide a b = Just' $ a 'div' b

from_just' :: Maybe' a -> a
from_just' (Just' a) = a

data Tuple a b = Tuple a b a
```
