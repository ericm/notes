## Types
- User defined types always have names that start with upper case letters.
- Function names snake case.
### `copy as`
- `as` is the parameter. Idiomatically call a list of values `as`.
	```hs
	copy as
		= if null as
		  then []
		  else head as: copy (tail as)
	copy :: [Int] -> [Int] -- :: is 'has type'
	copy :: [a] -> [a] -- generic name only scoped in this delcaration.
	```
