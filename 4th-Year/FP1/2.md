#  FP1 Lecture 2
15th September 2021

## Types
- User defined types always have names that start with upper case letters.
- Function names snake case.
- Arrie: Number of arrows in constructor 
	- Arrows point to next param and last value is return type.
### `copy as`
- `as` is the parameter. Idiomatically call a list of values `as`.
	```hs
	copy as
		= if null as
		  then []
		  else head as: copy (tail as)
	copy :: [Int] -> [Int] -- :: is 'has type'
	copy :: [a] -> [a] -- generic name only scoped in this delcaration.
	```
## Scripts
- `.lhs`: Literate Haskell Script.
	- Only lines which start with `>` in the first column are part of the script.
	- Scripts can be embedded in other program files using comments. EG: R.
	- `ghc -c Main.lhs`
	- `ghc -o Main Main.o`
	- Interactive: `ghci Main.lhs`
- `.hs`: Haskell Script.
	- Every line part of script.
- Block comments: `{- -}`

## Prelude Library
### Maths
- `(+)`
- `(-)`
- `quot`: Quotient
- `rem`: Remainder
- `quotRem`: Quotient Remainder
### Tuples
- `(,) a b`: Constructor for 2-tuple.
	- Alternative: `(a,b)`
	- `(,) :: a -> b -> (a,b)`
- `(,,)`:  Three arrie.
### Lists
```hs
[] :: [a]
(:) :: a -> [a] -> 
	2:(1:[])
	[2,1]
	
	(:) 2 ((:)1 [])

```
#### `head`
```hs
head   :: [a] -> a
tail   :: [a] -> a
length :: [a] -> Int
null   :: [a] -> Bool
(!!)   :: [a] -> Int
	   [1,2] !! 	
	   1
```
