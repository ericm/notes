#  FP1 Lecture 3
20th September 2021

## Lab plan
- Standard library prelude [[FP1/2#Prelude Library]].
- Constraints.
- Evaluation on demand.
- Expressions only evaled once.
- Order evaluation.

## Index
```hs
(!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a -- This is called with prefix so this order makes sense.
> (!!) 2 [1,2,3,4]
	3
f :: Int -> Int
f = (!!) a [1,2,3,4]
```

## List Operations
```hs
take :: Int -> [a] -> a
> take 2 [1,2,3,4]
	[1,2]
> init [1,2,3]
	[1,2]
> reverse [1,2,3]
	[3,2,1]
repeat :: a -> [a] -- infinite copies of value
replicate :: Int -> a -> [a] -- repeate n times
```

## Polymorphyic type system
```hs
sum :: Num a => [a] -> a -- Double arrow denotes class Num must be extended by type a.
```

## Order of evaluation
```hs
> (1 + 2) - (3 - 4) -- which group gets evaled first doesn't matter.
```
Caching and memoization may affect order of evaluation.
