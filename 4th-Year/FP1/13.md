## Prelude hiding
```hs
import Prelude hiding(head, tail)
import qualified Prelude(head,tail)
Prelude.tail -- is tail
```

## Modify object
```hs
list' = list { head = 3 } -- returns object with said field changed.
```

## Cipher
```hs
table :: [Float]
table = [8.1,1.5,...]

positions :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> [Int]
positions a as = [i | (i,a') <- filter valid $ zip [0..] as]
	where valid (_,a') = a == a'
```
