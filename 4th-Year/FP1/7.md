4th October 2021

## Where
```hs
fs = 0:1:ps
	where ps = [a+b|(a,b)<-zip fs (fail fs)]
-- vs
pair :: ([Int], [(Int, Int)])
pair = (fs, ps)
fs = 0:1:[a+b|(a,b) <- ps] -- coming from below
ps = zip fs (tail fs) -- coming from above, tail recursion(?)
```

## Main Thread
```hs
main :: IO ()
main = do
		 ...
		 ...
		 ...
		 str <- getline -- stdin
		 let var = str ++ "\n"
		 putStr var -- putStr :: String -> IO()
		 return () -- to IO()
main = getline >>= (\str ->
       let var = str ++ "\n" >>
       putStr var 
)
```

## Quick sort
```hs
partition :: a -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
partition a as = (les, gts)
				 where les = [a' | a' <- as, a' <= a]
				       gts = [a' | a' <- as, a' > a]
qs1 :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
qs1 [] = []
qs1 as = qs as []
	where qs [] gts' = gts'
		  qs (a:as) gts' = qs les (a:qs gts gts')
		  		    where (les,gts) = partition a as
```
