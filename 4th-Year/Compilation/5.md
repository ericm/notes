## Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Must reach final state (double circle).

### Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
- Directed graph.
- No 2 names bearing the same label come from same state
- No epsilon.

### Non-deterministic (NFA)
- Subsumes [[#Deterministic Finite Automata DFA]].
- Epsilon transition - optional, can go at any time arbitrarily, (Non deterministic).

#### Closure
Algorithm to find set of states reachable from that state using epsilon transitions only.
- Graph exploration problem.
- DFS in transition graph to find all possible states from current state.
