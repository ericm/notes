## Frontend vs Backend
- Frontend is parsing the source code, maybe into an IR.
- Backend is synthesising the IR into machine readable code.

## Lexical Analysis
- Removes unnecessary tokens (comments, etc).
- Provides array of tokens to next stage.
- Think regex.

## Parsing
- Syntax Tree
	- Put subscopes/conditions into tree to be iterated through.
	
## Translation
1. Start with tree.
2. Traverse tree based on intermediary nodes.
3. Generate IR code whilest traversing.
