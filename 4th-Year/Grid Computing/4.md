## Matrices
- Double pointer.
- Static delcaration not favoured since all values have to be allocated contiguously in memory.
- Dynamic double pointer allows for matrix to be spread out in memory by row.
- Sine rows are stored sequentially, L2 and L3 cache have to be accessed a lot due to the size of the rows if you want to traverse a column.

### Scatter
n\*m matrix split into n/size\*m matrices.
- Scattering must be done to allow for matrix multiplication. (between A and B). (**Linear Strategy**).

#### 2d partitioning
- Instead of dividing matrix linearly, divide into equal blocks.
- **Block Matrix Multiplication**.
- **Divide and conqure**: Multiply relevant submatrices, add up products at end.
- **Strassen's Algorithm**:
