#  Grid Computing Lecture 3
30th September 2021

## P2P operations
- **Prefix**: `MPI_I`

## Collective
### Synchronization
- Reach point in program together.
### Data Movement
- Send out data and gather it.
### Computation
- Compute segments of data.
### Routines
- `MPI_BCast`: Send message to all other processes in that group.
- `MPI_Reduce`: Applies operation on data on processes in group and puts into buffer.
- `MPI_Scatter`: Scatter `sendcount` segments to processes in group.

## Pointers
- `malloc`: Memory alloc buffer of n bytes.
- `calloc`: Alloc x buffers of n bytes.

### Workflow
1. Scatter
2. Compute 
3. Reduce to global result.
