#  Grid Computing Lecture 6
21st October 2021

## Assignment
- At least 1 difficult sort: bucket sort, merge sort or pythonic sort.

## Compare and Exchange
- When all elements in rank n < rank n+1, O(1) OP, sorting is done.
- Just gather is required.

## Odd-Even Sort
- if rank has same odd/even value as step, exchange arr with next proc.
- if rank has different odd/even value as step, exchange arr with prev proc.
- Gather sub arrays back to root.

## isSorted
- Comparet first element of processor n with last element in processor n-1.

## Shell Sort
- Group into k shells.
- Shell is a groupe of processors.
- Processors that are equally distances from either max or min share data.
### Dividing
Running on proc: self selects and reduces shell each step.
```c
Shell = (l, l+1, ..., r-1,r)

l=0, r=size-1
while l <= r {
	pair = (l+r) - rank // l+r will always be the same since each time l increases, r decreases.
	if pair < rank {
		exchange(pair,rank)
	}
	else if pair > rank {
		exchange(rank, pair)
	}
	mid = (l+r)//2
	if mid < rank {
		l=m+1
	} else {
		r=m
	}
}
```
