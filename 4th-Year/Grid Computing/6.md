- At least 1 difficult sort: bucket sort, merge sort or pythonic sort.

## Compare and Exchange
- When all elements in rank n < rank n+1, O(1) OP, sorting is done.
- Just gather is required.

## Odd-Even Sort
- if rank has same odd/even value as step, exchange arr with next proc.
- if rank has different odd/even value as step, exchange arr with prev proc.
- Gather sub arrays back to root.

## isSorted
- Comparet first element of processor n with last element in processor n-1.

## Shell Sort
- Group into k shells.
- Shell is a groupe of processors.
