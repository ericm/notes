## Polynomial Regression
- Polynomial features preprocessor before linear regression will work.
- Transforms features by making them products of the last one.
- If linear model underfits, change to quadratic or more.
- Increase polynomial degree to high and it will overfit.
- Compare polynomial degrees to validation error (unseen data if no leakage).
- Larger gap between training error and validation error means overfitting.
