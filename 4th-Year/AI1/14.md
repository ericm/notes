## Decision Tree
- Binary Tree.
- X hand side of node should mean a particular class.
- Break down dataset until y class values are *pure*.
	- Has 0 and another value.
	- This means they only contain one desired class.
	- *gini* is score of how pure they are.
- If gini is not 0, split it.
	- Max depth will stop split.
- May not end up pure if there is duplicate values with different classes.
- Can be used for numeric values as well.
	- Right hand side greater, left hand side less.
