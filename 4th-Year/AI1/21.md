## Convolutional Neural Networks
- Higher layers combine information from lower layers to understand a greater picture.
### Images
- Don't flatten, keep images as 3 Tensors.
- Flattening loses contiguity (things being next to each other).
- Output dense layer should have a hidden layer for each class.
## Layers
### MaxPooling
### Conv2D
