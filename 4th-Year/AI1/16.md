## Accuracy Estimation
- Correct predictions : number of predictions.
### Limitations
- Inaccuracy on certain outcomes may be undesirable: important in spam.
- 90% spam 10% ham, a dumb classifier can get 90% accuracy by spamming everything.

## Majority Class
- `DummyClassifier`
- Check how well it does by always predicting majority class.

## Confusion Matrix (Table)
- Actual Classes x Predicted Classes - CxC.
- Shows number of actual classes predicted as each class.

## Stratification
- Possibility that more examples of certain outcome in test/train set.
	- Not as good to train on.
1. Randomly partition separate sets of each outcome.
2. Union train sets of each outcome as train set.
3. Do the same for test set.
