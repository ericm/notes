## Over/Under-fitting remedies
### Underfitting
- Fix underfitting by adding to model, making more complex.
	- Makes more parameters in model.
### Overfitting
- Increase training examples to reduce effect of noise.
- Reduce noise with preprocessors.

## Regularisation linear regression
- Reduce coefficients.
- Impose a penalty on the size of the coefficients. 
	1. l1 norm - sum of absolute value of the coefficients.
	2. lasso regression - uses l1 norm by the regularisation parameter to control normalisation.
