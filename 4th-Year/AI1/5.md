## Linear Equations and Vectors
- Variables **x**s can be put into row vector.
- **β** is coefficieants.
- [[AI1/2#Matrix Multiplication]] them together, adding **β**0.
- Instead of adding **β**0, prepend 1 to **x**.
- You can limit hypotheses to linear equations (same shape).
	- **Linear Model**.
	
## Loss functions
- Scores coefficiants using loss function.
- Modifies coefficiants based on previous bests. (fitting).
- Compares square mean difference between predicted output from hypothesis with actual training value **mean squared error**.
	- Squaring keeps sum positive.
