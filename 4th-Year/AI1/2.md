## Matrix
- Subscript: `Ai,j`
- Index: `A[i,j]`
- Rows before columns in `m x n`
- Index from 1
- Upper case letter
- pandas: `DataFrames`: table.

## Vector
-  `m x 1` matrix
- Lower case letter
- Default column vector, alternatively, a row vector.
- pandas: `Series`

## numpy
- Store in `np.array`
- Array stored in sequential memory, 32 bit ints.

## Transpose
- Superscript t above matrix
- Inverts shape
- numpy: `A.transpose()`

## Tensors
- Describes shape of quantity
- Scalar: rank 0, vector rank 1, matrix: rank 2

## Operations
### Scalar Matrix
- Elementwise
### Power of Matrix
- Works elementwise on each element separately.
### Matrix Addition 
- Elementwise
- Same shape
### Hadamaard product
- Elementwise multiplication
- Not dot product
### Matrix Multiplication
- Aka dot product.
- Can have different shapes.
	- However number of columns in A must equal number of rows in B. Not commutative, else undefined
	- Transpose if required.
- Multiply each row of A by each column of B and aggregate.
### Identity Matrix
- Value that's result in an operation is unchanged.
- 1 is multiplications identity.
- Square
- `In[i,i] = 1`
- `In[i,j] = 0`
- Leaves matrix multiplied with unchanged
### Inverses
- `A A^-1 = In`
#### Psuedo Inverse
- All ones doesnt have inverse.
- Rough approximation of inverse gives one for all ones.
