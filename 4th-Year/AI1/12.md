## Data Cleaning
- Fix or delete erroneous values.
- `df.dropna` delete's row if any column specified is NaN.

## Data Exploration
- Visualise data only after test set is locked away.
- `df.corr`: shows correlations.

### Feature Engineering
- Create features out of existing features - composite features.
- Make them predictive - correlation.

### One Hot Encoding
- Split each option in a nominal feature into a binary feature.
- Avoids issues with numeric mapping such as closeness of values having weight due to them being the same feature.
