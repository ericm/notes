## Neural Networks
- Big function.
- Neuron stores weights: multiply weights by x input, feed into [[#Step Activation]].
### Step Activation
- Activated means a neuron forards to connected forwarding neurons.
- Many types of activation functions such as linear, step. sigmoid, ReLU
### Layers
- Weights on wires to neurons stored as matrix.
- Apply activation elementwise to weighted sums of each neuron in layer.
- **Dense**: Fully connected layer on layer.
- Add in bias on each layer to favour certain layers/nodes.
