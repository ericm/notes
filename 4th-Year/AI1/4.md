## Prediction
- `^y` is predicted value.

## Instance Based Supervised Learning
### Nearest Neighbour regression
- Most similar. 
- If features match, use value as prediction.
#### Standardisation scaling
Subtract mean and divide by standard deviation.
```py
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X) # Computes mean + standard deviation.
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X) # Creates scaled version based on computed vals.
```

### K-[[#Nearest Neighbour regression]]
- [[#Nearest Neighbour regression]] has issue of being influenced completely by noise.
- Get mean of the `k` closest feature sets using `np.argsort`.
- scikitlearn: `KNeighborsRegressor`.

## Model Based Supervised Learning
- **Model** is *formula* computed (learned) by algorithm over dataset.
- Can be plotted on graph.
- Hypotheses are created based on training data until unknown target function which represents most optimal function is approximately found.
- scikitlearn example: `LinearRegression`.
